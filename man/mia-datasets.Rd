These example data objects were prepared to serve as examples. See the
details for more information.

\details{
For \code{*_graph} data:
\enumerate{
\item \dQuote{Jaccard} distances were calculated via
\code{calculateDistance(genus, FUN = vegan::vegdist, method = "jaccard",exprs_values = "relabundance")},
either using transposed assay data or not to calculate distances for samples
or features.
\item \dQuote{Jaccard} dissimilarites were converted to similarities and values
above a threshold were used to construct a graph via
\code{graph.adjacency(mode = "lower", weighted = TRUE)}.
\item The \code{igraph} object was converted to \code{tbl_graph} via
\code{as_tbl_graph} from the \code{tidygraph} package.
