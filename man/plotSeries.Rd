\arguments{
\item{object}{a
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{SummarizedExperiment}}
object.}

\item{x}{a single character value for selecting the column from
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{ColData}} that
will specify values of x-axis.}

\item{y}{a single character value for selecting the taxa from
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{rownames}}.
This parameter specifies taxa whose abundances will be plotted.}

\item{rank}{a single character value defining a taxonomic rank, that is used
to agglomerate the data. Must be a value of \code{taxonomicRanks()}
function.}

\item{colour_by}{a single character value defining a taxonomic rank, that is used to
color plot. Must be a value of \code{taxonomicRanks()} function.}

\item{size_by}{a single character value defining a taxonomic rank, that is
used to divide taxa to different line size types. Must be a value of
\code{taxonomicRanks()} function.}

\item{linetype_by}{a single character value defining a taxonomic rank, that
is used to divide taxa to different line types. Must be a value of
\code{taxonomicRanks()} function.}

\item{assay.type}{a single character value for selecting the
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{assay}} to be
plotted. (default: \code{assay.type = "counts"})}

\item{assay_name}{a single \code{character} value for specifying which
assay to use for calculation.
(Please use \code{assay.type} instead. At some point \code{assay_name}
will be disabled.)}

\item{...}{additional parameters for plotting. See
\code{\link{mia-plot-args}} for more details i.e. call \code{help("mia-plot-args")}}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object
}
\description{
This function plots series data.
}
\details{
This function creates series plot, where x-axis includes e.g. time points, and
y-axis abundances of selected taxa.

\dontrun{
library(mia)
# Load data from miaTime package
library("miaTime")
